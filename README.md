Repository for DemoSat Sattilite code

This sattilite will be launching ~November, 2012. It collects data on the Earth's albedo, formats the data, and then 
sends it out to a data logging system. Albedo is a mesurement of how reflective a surface is. In order to do this, we
gather ambient light mesurements from the top sensor, and then devide the light mesurements that we get from both the
bottom sensors and the side sensors, by that value.
